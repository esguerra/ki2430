  labstract = {RNAexinv is an interactive java application that performs RNA sequence
	design, constrained to yield a specific RNA shape and physical attributes.
	It is an extended inverse RNA folding program with the rationale
	behind that the generated sequences should not only fold into a desired
	structure, but they should also exhibit favorable attributes such
	as thermodynamic stability and mutational robustness. RNAexinv considers
	not only the secondary structure in order to design sequences, but
	also the mutational robustness and the minimum free energy. The sequences
	that are generated may not fully conform with the given RNA secondary
	structure, but they will strictly conform with the RNA shape of the
	given secondary structure and thereby take into consideration the
	recommended values of thermodynamic stability and mutational robustness
	that are provided.The output consists of designed sequences that
	are generated by the proposed method. Selecting a sequence displays
	the secondary structure drawings of the target and the predicted
	fold of the sequence, including some basic information about the
	desired and achieved thermodynamic stability and mutational robustness.
	RNAexinv can be used successfully without prior experience, simply
	specifying an initial RNA secondary structure in dot-bracket notation
	and numerical values for the desired neutrality and minimum free
	energy. The package runs under LINUX operating system. Secondary
	structure predictions are performed using the Vienna RNA package.RNAexinv
	is a user friendly tool that can be used for RNA sequence design.
	It is especially useful in cases where a functional stem-loop structure
	of a natural sequence should be strictly kept in the designed sequences
	but a distant motif in the rest of the structure may contain one
	more or less nucleotide at the expense of another, as long as the
	global shape is preserved. This allows the insertion of physical
	observables as constraints. RNAexinv is available at http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~RNAexinv.},

  labstract = {Joint alignment and secondary structure prediction of two RNA sequences
	can significantly improve the accuracy of the structural predictions.
	Methods addressing this problem, however, are forced to employ constraints
	that reduce computation by restricting the alignments and/or structures
	(i.e. folds) that are permissible. In this paper, a new methodology
	is presented for the purpose of establishing alignment constraints
	based on nucleotide alignment and insertion posterior probabilities.
	Using a hidden Markov model, posterior probabilities of alignment
	and insertion are computed for all possible pairings of nucleotide
	positions from the two sequences. These alignment and insertion posterior
	probabilities are additively combined to obtain probabilities of
	co-incidence for nucleotide position pairs. A suitable alignment
	constraint is obtained by thresholding the co-incidence probabilities.
	The constraint is integrated with Dynalign, a free energy minimization
	algorithm for joint alignment and secondary structure prediction.
	The resulting method is benchmarked against the previous version
	of Dynalign and against other programs for pairwise RNA structure
	prediction.The proposed technique eliminates manual parameter selection
	in Dynalign and provides significant computational time savings in
	comparison to prior constraints in Dynalign while simultaneously
	providing a small improvement in the structural prediction accuracy.
	Savings are also realized in memory. In experiments over a 5S RNA
	dataset with average sequence length of approximately 120 nucleotides,
	the method reduces computation by a factor of 2. The method performs
	favorably in comparison to other programs for pairwise RNA structure
	prediction: yielding better accuracy, on average, and requiring significantly
	lesser computational resources.Probabilistic analysis can be utilized
	in order to automate the determination of alignment constraints for
	pairwise RNA structure prediction methods in a principled fashion.
	These constraints can reduce the computational and memory requirements
	of these methods while maintaining or improving their accuracy of
	structural prediction. This extends the practical reach of these
	methods to longer length sequences. The revised Dynalign code is
	freely available for download.},

  labstract = {The goal of this biophysical experiment is to measure thermodynamic
	properties of a short DNA duplex by melting the ordered native structure
	(duplex) into the disordered, denatured state (single strands) while

	DNA samples we used were two complementary synthetic DNA oligomers,
	dCA7G and dCT7G. The absorbance of four separate DNA samples with
	different concentrations (10-75 microM for each single strand) is
	measured at 260 nm as the temperature is increased from 10 to 70
	degrees C. As the ordered regions of stacked base pairs in the DNA
	duplex are disrupted, the UV absorbance increases. The profile of
	UV absorbance versus temperature is called a melting curve and the
	midpoint of the transition is defined as the melting temperature,
	Tm. The dependence of Tm on strand concentration can be analyzed
	to yield quantitative thermodynamic data (deltaH, deltaS, deltaG).},

	in computing a free-energy based score assuming that single base-pair
	energies could be additive.},
  file = {../nussinov1978.pdf},
  labstract = {A simplified (two-base) version of the problem of planar folding of
	long chains (e.g. RNA and DNA biomolecules) is formulated as a matching
	problem. The chain is prescribed as a loop or circular sequence of
	letter A and B, n units long. A matching here means a set of A-B
	base pairings or matches obeying a planarity condition: no two matches
	may cross each other if drawn on the interior of the loop. Alsom
	no two adjacent letters may be matched. We present a dynamic programming
	algorithm requiring O(n3) steps and O(n2) storage which computes
	the size of the maximum for the given A-B base sequence and which
	also allows reconstructing a particular folded form of the original
	string which realizes the maximum matching size. The algorithm can
	be adapted to deal with sequences with larger alphabets and with
	weighted matchings. 
	
	An algorithm is presented for a modified problem closer to the biochemical
	problem of interest: We demand that evey match must be adjacent to
	anoother match, forcing groups of two of more parallel matches.
	
	Some results on the expected maximum matching size are presented.
	As n tends to infinity, at least 80 percent of the vertices can be
	matched on the average on an A-B string of size n.
	
	We briefly discuss the practical application of the algorithm by using
	contracted versions of very long molecules with a preliminary block
	construction. A maximum matching is presented for the J-gene of the
	phiX174 DNA virus. We conclude by stating some problems requiring
	furter study.},
