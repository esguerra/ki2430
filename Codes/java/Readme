A Java GUI has been developed by Norman Casagrande and Patrick Dekker
to use the Nussinov algorithm to predict secondary structure folds of
RNA sequences. At the same time the GUI explains step by step how to
fill up the dynamic programing table.

The java app can be found at the internet access:

But can also be run by opening the file:
baba/nussinov.htm
In a java enabled browser like fedora or google-chrome.
